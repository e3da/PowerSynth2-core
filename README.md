# PowerSynth 2 Release Series Core Repository
## Repository Overview
This is the core repository for PowerSynth 2. Refer to the [PowerSynth2-gui](https://github.com/e3da/PowerSynth2-gui) and other related repos for the GUI and other parts. Both Windows and Linux installers are released through the [PowerSynth Release Website](https://e3da.csce.uark.edu/release/PowerSynth/), with installation instructions and documentations included in the [PowerSynth2-pkg](https://github.com/e3da/PowerSynth2-pkg) repo. 

This repository contains the main source code for the PowerSynth 2 layout engine, models, optimization algorithms, and the command line interface (CLI). 
The source code is re-created based on the release version v1.9. It is developed on Linux and then ported to Windows before release. The code is migrated to python 3 with additional modules from different research projects. It can be run in CLI mode together with the pkg repository without GUI.

v2.0 is targeted at a minimum code base, thus many optional (or experimental) modules are removed in the initial release. Not all features of PowerSynth 2 are exposed in this release. But its capabilities will gradually grow with further research, development, and testing.

# PowerSynth 2 Project Overview
PowerSynth 2 started as a research project to introduce the VLSI electronics design automation algorithms for power electronic applications. It is developed originally by the [E3DA Lab](https://e3da.csce.uark.edu/) as a POETS project and then jointly by [MSCAD Lab](https://mscad.uark.edu/), at University of Arkansas. 

PowerSynth 2 was first developed as an enhanced layout engine for PowerSynth 1 to handle design constraints in complicated layouts with efficiency improvements. The new layout engine is first previewed in PowerSynth v1.3, and then became the sole engine in v1.9. In addition, new 3D layout algorithms, electrical/thermal models are introduced in v2.0, with improved optimization algorithms introduced in v2.1, and custom devices and power converter design support in v2.2.

The PowerSynth 2 project is co-directed by [Prof. Yarui Peng](https://engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/yrpeng/name/Yarui+Peng/) and [Prof. Alan Mantooth](https://engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/mantooth/name/Alan+Mantooth/). The research project is mainly supported by NSF through POETS ERC, ARL, and ARPA-E through a series of grants. 

The main developers of this release series include Mehran Sanjabiasasi, Imam Al Razi, Quang Le, and Tristan Evans. The initial GUI is mainly developed by Joshua Mitchener as an REU project. The codebase also received contributions from many collaborators, graduates, and undergrads.
